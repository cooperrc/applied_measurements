OBJECTIVE

1) Gain familiarity with the physical operating principle of Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) measurements
2) Calibrate the LVDT measurement using voltage measurements
3) Determine relationship between supplied voltage amplitude and linear motion
4) Investigate effects of changing input frequency and sampling rate on response frequency
