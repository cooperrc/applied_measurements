The objectives of this experiment are:
1. Understand and practice basic heat exchanger analysis methods.
2. Measure the hot and cold fluid temperatures and mass flow rates.
3. Calculate the experimental heat exchanger effectiveness and other performance metrics and compare to the predicted effectiveness obtained by the NTU method.
4. Learn how to apply this analysis to determine cross-flow heat exchanger performance.
