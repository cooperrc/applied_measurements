## Lab #1 - Heat Engine

The objectives of this laboratory are :

1. Determination of thermodynamic work done during a four-stage expansion and compression cycle by lifting masses from one height to another.
2. Compare the useful mechanical work and the net thermodynamic work done during a cycle as determined via a p-V diagram.
